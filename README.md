# Fitness AI Tracker

## Short Description

The Health and Fitness Tracker is an interactive web-based application that empowers users to track their health and fitness data, receive personalized insights, and benefit from machine learning-based recommendations. The project combines data science and web development skills to provide users with a seamless experience in managing their health and fitness goals. Users can sign up, log in, and input their daily health data, such as calorie intake, exercise duration, steps walked, heart rate, and more. The application uses data analysis and machine learning algorithms to offer personalized recommendations and predictions based on the user's data and fitness objectives.
